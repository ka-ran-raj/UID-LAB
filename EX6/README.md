# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Description: Weather Application for Specific Location
The Weather Application is a React-based project designed to display weather forecasts for a user-specified location. The application will interact with a weather API to fetch real-time weather data and display it in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Features:
Location-based Weather Forecast:

Users will input a city or location in a search bar, and the application will display the current weather conditions as well as future forecasts (if available).
The application will send the location to a weather API and retrieve data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rain).
Weather API Integration:

The application will use a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) to fetch weather data for the specified location.
A GET request will be sent to the API, and the response will include detailed weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Dynamic Weather Display:

Upon receiving data from the API, the application will display the following:
Current Weather: Temperature, weather description (e.g., clear sky, rain), humidity, and wind speed.
5-day Forecast: If available, a 5-day weather forecast showing daily temperatures and conditions.
The displayed information will update dynamically whenever the user searches for a new location.
User Input Handling:

The application will feature a search bar where users can input their desired location (e.g., city or ZIP code).
After the user submits a location, the application will fetch and display the relevant weather data.
Error Handling:

If the user inputs an invalid location or if the weather data for the specified location is unavailable, the application will display an appropriate error message.
This ensures a smooth user experience even if the API request fails.
Real-time Updates:

The application will retrieve and display real-time weather data for the specified location, ensuring that users always have up-to-date information.
Interactive and Attractive UI:

The weather data will be displayed in a visually appealing format, using cards or a grid system to present information like temperature, weather conditions, and forecast.
The UI will be interactive, with hover effects, clear icons (e.g., sun, cloud, rain), and a modern design.
The background may dynamically change based on the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, or snowy).
Responsive Design:

The application will be fully responsive, ensuring that users can access it on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Weather data will be formatted to display optimally across all screen sizes.
Optional Features (If required):

Geolocation: The application can automatically detect the user's location using the browserâ€™s geolocation API and display weather data for that location without requiring manual input.
Units Toggle: Users can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature display.
Weather Icons: The application can use dynamic weather icons to visually represent conditions like sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy.
By integrating real-time weather data from a reliable API and providing an intuitive, responsive interface, this weather application will allow users to easily view current and future weather conditions for any specific location of their choice.
