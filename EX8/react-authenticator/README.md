# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Authentication System Description
Overview
The Authentication System is a critical component of modern web applications, enabling secure access to user accounts and sensitive data. This system is designed to manage user authentication and authorization efficiently, ensuring that only legitimate users can access specific functionalities and resources. By implementing secure authentication practices, the system enhances user trust and protects against unauthorized access.

Key Components
User Registration:

Purpose: Allow new users to create accounts within the system.
Process: Users provide essential information such as their name, email address, and password through a registration form. Upon submission, the system checks for existing accounts using the provided email.
Security: Passwords are hashed using a strong hashing algorithm (bcrypt) before storing them in the database, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure.
User Login:

Purpose: Authenticate users attempting to access their accounts.
Process: Users enter their registered email and password. The system verifies the provided credentials against stored data.
Token Generation: Upon successful authentication, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and sent to the client, allowing secure access to protected resources.
Session Management:

Purpose: Maintain user sessions and manage access control.
Implementation: The JWT is stored securely in local storage on the client-side. This token is included in the header of subsequent requests to authenticate the user without requiring repeated logins.
Logout Functionality: Users can log out, which removes the token from local storage, effectively ending the session and preventing further access until re-authentication.
Security Measures:

Password Security: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, making it computationally infeasible for attackers to retrieve the original passwords.
Token-Based Authentication: JWTs are used for secure communication between the client and server, with features like token expiration to enhance security.
Input Validation: All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
Error Handling:

The system provides clear and informative error messages during the registration and login processes, guiding users in correcting their input if issues arise (e.g., duplicate email, incorrect password).
Technologies Used
Frontend: React for building a dynamic user interface and Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
Backend: Node.js with Express to create RESTful API endpoints for handling authentication logic.
Database: MongoDB to store user information securely, including hashed passwords and user profiles.
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session management and user verification.
Security Libraries: Bcrypt for password hashing and JSONWebToken for creating and verifying tokens.
Conclusion
The Authentication System is designed to provide a secure and user-friendly experience for managing user accounts. By incorporating robust security measures and an intuitive interface, the system ensures that users can access their accounts safely while protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. This system is essential for any web application requiring user authentication and forms the backbone of secure user interactions.
