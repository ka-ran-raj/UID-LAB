# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Description: E-Commerce Website Shopping Cart
Overview
The E-Commerce Website Shopping Cart is a web-based application that provides a seamless shopping experience for users, allowing them to browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. This project focuses on the shopping cart functionality, which is a crucial component of any e-commerce platform. The application is built using React for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture.

Problem Statement
In the growing digital marketplace, providing users with a smooth and efficient shopping experience is essential for retaining customers and increasing sales. Many existing e-commerce platforms suffer from cumbersome cart management systems that lead to frustration. The E-Commerce Website Shopping Cart aims to address this issue by delivering an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enhances the shopping process.

Objectives
User-Friendly Interface: Develop an easy-to-navigate interface for users to browse products and manage their shopping carts.
Efficient Cart Management: Allow users to add, remove, and update product quantities within their shopping cart seamlessly.
Real-Time Updates: Ensure the shopping cart reflects real-time changes as users add or modify items.
Data Persistence: Store cart information in a MongoDB database, allowing users to retain their selections even when they leave the site and return later.
Secure Checkout Process: Implement a secure and efficient checkout process that captures user details and processes payments.
Technology Used
Frontend:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling a component-based architecture for modular development.
CSS: For styling the application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
Backend:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows the server to handle multiple requests efficiently.
Express: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies API development and routing.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a straightforward way to interact with the database.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing product and cart data, allowing for flexibility in data storage.
Module Descriptions
Frontend Module:

Product List Component: Displays a list of available products with details such as name, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
Shopping Cart Component: Shows the items currently in the cart, allowing users to modify quantities or remove items.
Checkout Component: Facilitates the checkout process, where users can enter their shipping and payment information.
Backend Module:

API Endpoints:
GET /api/products: Fetches the list of products available for sale.
POST /api/cart: Adds items to the user's shopping cart in the database.
GET /api/cart: Retrieves the user's shopping cart items from the database.
DELETE /api/cart/:itemId: Removes an item from the user's shopping cart.
POST /api/checkout: Processes the user's order and payment details.
Database Connection: Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database to store and retrieve product and cart data.
Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture, with a clear separation between the frontend and backend components:

Conclusion
The E-Commerce Website Shopping Cart project serves as a fundamental component of an online shopping platform, demonstrating critical concepts in web development, such as CRUD operations, data persistence, and secure payment processing. By focusing on user experience and efficient cart management, this project aims to provide a solid foundation for building a fully functional e-commerce website. Future enhancements could include features like user authentication, order history, and product recommendations.
