# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Description: To-Do List Application using React Hooks
Project Title: To-Do List Application

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a responsive, feature-rich To-Do List application using React and React Hooks. The app allows users to add, manage, and track their tasks efficiently by marking them as complete, deleting tasks, and logging the date and time each task was created.

Key Features:

Task Addition: Users can add new tasks to the list. Each task includes a title, completion status, and a timestamp indicating when it was added.
Task Completion: Tasks can be toggled between completed and incomplete. Completed tasks are visually differentiated by striking through the task name.
Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
Timestamp: Each task displays the date and time it was added, allowing users to track when tasks were created.
User-Friendly Interface: The application features an intuitive interface with input fields for task addition, easy-to-use buttons for task management, and attractive UI/UX using CSS.
Technologies Used:

React: For building the user interface and handling state with React Hooks (useState).
CSS: For styling the interface and ensuring a responsive design.
React Hooks:

useState: Used to manage the state of tasks and input values. This allows dynamic rendering and interaction without page reloads.
File Structure:

App.js: Contains the main logic of the application, including task addition, toggling completion, and deletion.
App.css: Defines the visual appearance and styles for the application.
Project Workflow:

UI Layout: A simple form with an input field and a button to add new tasks.
State Management: Tasks are stored in a list using useState. The list includes the task description, completion status, and a timestamp.
Task Manipulation: The user can interact with tasks by marking them as complete or deleting them. The application updates dynamically as tasks are added, deleted, or modified.
Styling: CSS is used to differentiate between completed and pending tasks, provide hover effects for buttons, and ensure the layout is visually appealing.
Future Enhancements:

Implement a local storage feature to persist tasks across sessions.
Add a priority feature to categorize tasks.
Integrate a due date feature with reminders for upcoming tasks.
This project serves as a practical demonstration of how to build dynamic user interfaces with React and React Hooks, focusing on state management, user interaction, and responsive design.
